# FusionAuth Web SDKs

Hi! This is the future home of the FusionAuth Web SDKs monorepo.

ðŸš§ This is currently a WIP, so please check back soon. ðŸš§

For now, please view the existing repos:

* [FusionAuth React SDK](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-react-sdk)
* [FusionAuth Angular SDK](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-angular-sdk)
* [FusionAuth Vue SDK](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-vue-sdk)

## Upgrade Policy

This library may periodically receive updates with bug fixes, security patches, tests, code samples, or documentation changes.

These releases may also update dependencies, language engines, and operating systems, as we\'ll follow the deprecation and sunsetting policies of the underlying technologies that the libraries use.

This means that after a dependency (e.g. language, framework, or operating system) is deprecated by its maintainer, this library will also be deprecated by us, and may eventually be updated to use a newer version.

# FusionAuth Web SDKs

This is the FusionAuth Web SDKs monorepo. This repo manages FusionAuth [React](https://fusionauth.io/docs/sdks/react-sdk), [Angular](https://fusionauth.io/docs/sdks/angular-sdk), and [Vue](https://fusionauth.io/docs/sdks/vue-sdk) SDKs.

Each SDK in this repo offers the configuration options of [`SDKConfig`](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-javascript-sdk/blob/main/packages/core/src/SDKConfig/SDKConfig.ts) along with the functionality of [`SDKContext`](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-javascript-sdk/blob/main/packages/core/src/SDKContext/SDKContext.ts).

## Upgrade Policy

This library may periodically receive updates with bug fixes, security patches, tests, code samples, or documentation changes.

These releases may also update dependencies, language engines, and operating systems, as we\'ll follow the deprecation and sunsetting policies of the underlying technologies that the libraries use.

This means that after a dependency (e.g. language, framework, or operating system) is deprecated by its maintainer, this library will also be deprecated by us, and may eventually be updated to use a newer version.
